This repo is for the practice project which is to be based on Embedded AI libraries. 

This project uses Embeddable Watson AI Libraries, specifically the Watson NLP Library. As this project was completed using the
Skills Network Labs Cloud IDE, these libraries were pre-installed. You can find the library at the following link:

# The NLP Library
The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio. The text-to-speech library generates natural sounding audio from written text.
